# YouTubePD-data
Construct and preprocess video dataset for Parkinson's disease (PD) from YouTube. Please set up the instructions in `PDRegionExtraction` for extracting PD-informative facial regions--bounding boxes are interpolated by modifying `MMPose` framework. The region extraction was run on a single V100 GPU. The resulting bounding box coordinates are provided, so this step may be skipped. In the `data` folder, two datasheets are provided. The first datasheet downloads a balanced PD positive/negative dataset, and the second datasheet downlaods only PD-negative videos to expand the dataset. In the `data` folder, the train and test data splits are also provided, that map each video to its label (PD severity score). Select the datasheet you want to download from, and construct and preprocess the dataset using `prepare_data.py`.

The region-level binary annotations are provided in a dictionary format in `region_video_annotations.pkl`, to be loaded into the model. Each video is a key in the dictionary; the corresponding value is an array of strings. Each string is in the format `annotated_frame_num/total_frame_num, region_index, severity, confidence`. The training code directly uses the file in this format to load in region annotations.

Examples of the processed videos can be found in the `processed_examples` folder. Two example videos are provided, with and without visualized bboxes for each.
